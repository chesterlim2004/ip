# Console UI Test Plan

The runner compiles every Java source under `src/main/java`, starts a fresh `Crystal` process in an isolated working directory for each test case, and checks each response before sending the next command. It supports case-specific starting files and compares expected saved files exactly without touching the developer's real data file. Console output is compared exactly after normalizing line endings. The shared `LINE` variable represents the application's horizontal divider.

Each test case below specifies its aim, command inputs, and expected output. An exchange with `expect_exit` must cause the program to terminate successfully.
